  <h1>Fun With Classes</h1>
  <canvas id="theCanvas"></canvas>
  
  <p>
  this example illustrates a simple implementation of javascript classes using the prototype to declare public methods.
  One drawback here is that the classes are declared in the global scope.  If we were to use other js libraries, we may
  have name clashes.
  </p><p>
  In addition, the properties and methods of the classes are all public and mutable.  This, in itself, is not a big problem
  as log as all the developers understand what is supposed to be mutable, and what is not.  As soon as one dev changes "immutable" 
  data, the class moves into the realms of "undefined behaviour"!
